# React Introduction

This project is a simple repo showing the basics of using react as a view layer in a web application. It was generated
using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) the officially supported starter
from the React team.

## Quick Start

**Requirements**:

- Node >= 4

Clone the repo and install the dependencies dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction
cd react-introduction
npm install
```

Run the app in browser with live reloading:

```
npm start
```

## How it works

When you run the above command `npm start` you will see the final app launched in your browser.

The basic html version of the app that we start with can be seen if 
you visit [http://localhost:3000/static/index.html](http://localhost:3000/static/index.html).
