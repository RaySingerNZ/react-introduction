                        Te Mata Peak is at the western boundary of the wine-producing Heretaunga Plains 
                        and stands nearly 400 metres above sea level. From the summit of the peak you can enjoy 
                        panoramic views of the Ruahine, Kaweka and Maungaharuru Ranges and Cape Kidnappers. 
                        The volcano Ruapehu, in the centre of Tongariro National Park, is also visible on a clear day.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        The nature trails on Te Mata Peak are great for hikers and mountain bikers. It's an excellent cardio 
                        workout going up, but the huge views make the exertion totally worthwhile. Other hiking and biking trails 
                        in the Te Mata Trust Park lead through forest and along limestone valleys.
