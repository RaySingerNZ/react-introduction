                    <p>
                        The Waikato River, New Zealand's longest river, moves gracefully north from Lake Taupo between banks 100 metres apart. 
                        Just before the Huka Falls it enters a shallow ravine of hard volcanic rock. 
                        The effect is nature's large-scale equivalent of a fire hose feeding into a very fine nozzle.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        The previously placid waters roar and rumble at great speed along the ravine
                        before bursting into space out over Huka Falls to crash into the turbulent pool 11 metres below. 
                        A foot bridge right at the top of the falls puts you in a prime position to get up close and 
                        witness the frightening display of more than 220,000 litres of water blasting by every second. 
                        If you'd like to see the power and fury of the falls up close, try a jet boat ride.
