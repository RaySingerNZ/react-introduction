                    <p>
                        Nugget Point is one of the most distinctive landforms along the Otago coast. It's a steep headland 
                        with a lighthouse and a scattering of rocky islets (The Nuggets). A five minute walk takes you to 
                        the lighthouse, where you'll enjoy amazing views along the coastline in both directions. If you look
                         down onto the rocks directly below the lighthouse, you'll see fur seals lolling about, playing in 
                         rock pools and generally having fun. Bring binoculars for close-up viewing of this breeding colony.

                        Nugget Point is also home to sea lions, sooty shearwaters, shags, yellow-eyed penguins, spoonbills 
                        and a breeding colony of gannets. Occasionally, elephant and leopard seals visit the area. If you 
                        watch the water for a while, you might see Hector's dolphins.From Nugget Point it's an easy walk to 
                        Roaring Bay, where you can hide and wait for yellow-eyed penguins. Early morning or sunset are the 
                        best times for viewing.
